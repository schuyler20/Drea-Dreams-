	<h1>Drea Dreams</h1>
	<p>My character's name is Drea Dreams. She lives in Dreamland, a place where all your dreams can come true just by the thought of mind. Drea has Jet black raven long locs with red streaks. She is very fashionable and also very smart. She wears glasses as well but they are not prescribed. She wears them to seem smarter by her appearance. </p>
