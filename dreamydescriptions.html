	<h1>Drea's Persona</h1>
	<p> Drea is gothic, which her parents don’t really approve of because imagicity is so used to brightness they can’t really accept and understand why she likes to dress with dark colors to express herself especially since she’s the brightest among them all. Drea is very energetic though, she’s also very curious and rebellious. She likes to do things at her own pace. Drea is also independent and stubborn at times. She makes other people laugh and tends to make a lot of trouble in the city because of her intense curiosity. However people love despite that and they are usually drawn to her. </p>
