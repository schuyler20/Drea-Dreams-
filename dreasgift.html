	<h1>What Makes Drea Special</h1>
	<p>Drea is psychokinesis, which is basically when you can move or create things with just thought of your mind, but she tends not to use that power a lot. People know her best for her pyrokinesis side which means she can manipulate, create and control fire with her mind.
