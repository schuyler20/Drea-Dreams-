	<h1>The Dance in Mind</h1>
	<p>The artistic inspiration for my final project is in a world filled with people my main character, Drea Dreams, feels as if she is dancing an endless performance on her own as everyone relies on her and looks at her for guidance and comfort the spotlight is directly on her and the pink outfit, symbolizing her gift, surrounded by the darkness, symbolizing her gothic personality, shows the contrast between the two things. I made it my own by adding multiple effects and overlays to suit the artistic inspiration that I had envisioned. I chose to make my final project into a music video so instead of it just being a video it also contains music that I edited and played around with to my liking, with the song Dangerous Woman by Ariana Grande because I felt as if that song spoke truth to how powerful Drea is as a person and how she has a dark side to her that she canâ€™t help but to acknowledge. Some media techniques I used were layering and drawing. The video changed from my story board conception to finish by me adding in the extra effects I did not realize I was even going to do, some effects just seemed like a good idea to incorporate into my project at the moment.</p>
